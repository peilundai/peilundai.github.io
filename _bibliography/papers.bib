abstract="Face recognition (FR) is a natural and intuitive way for human beings to identify or verify or at least get familiar and interact with other members of the community. Hence, human beings expect and endeavor to develop similar competency in machine recognition of human faces. Due to the rapid increase in computing power in recent decades and the need to automate the FR tasks for many applications, researchers from diverse areas like cognitive and computer sciences are making efforts in understanding how humans and machines recognize human faces respectively. Its application is innumerable (like access control, surveillance, social interactions, e-commerce, just to name a few). In this chapter we will review two aspects of FR: machine recognition of faces and how human beings recognize human faces. We will also discuss the recent benchmark studies, their protocols and databases for FR and psychophysical studies of FR abilities of human beings.",

  abstract="Top-down attention plays an important role in guidance of human attention in real-world scenarios, but less efforts in computational modeing of visual attention has been put on it. Inspired by the mechanisms of top-down attention in human visual perception, we propose a multi-layer linear model of top-down attention to modulate bottom-up saliency maps actively. The first layer is a linear regression model which combines the bottom-up saliency maps on various visual features and objects. A contextual dependent upper layer is introduced to tune the parameters of the lower layer model adaptively. Finally, a mask of selection history is applied to the fused attention map to bias the attention selection towards the task related regions. Efficient learning algorithm with single-pass polynomial complexity is derived. We evaluate our model on a set of natural egocentric videos captured from a wearable glass in real-world environments. Our model outperforms the baseline and state-of-the-art bottom-up saliency models.",

  abstract="We here introduce and study the properties, via computer simulation, of a candidate automated approach to algorithmic reconstruction of dense neural morphology, based on simulated data of the kind that would be obtained via two emerging molecular technologies-expansion microscopy (ExM) and in-situ molecular barcoding. We utilize a convolutional neural network to detect neuronal boundaries from protein-tagged plasma membrane images obtained via ExM, as well as a subsequent supervoxel-merging pipeline guided by optical readout of information-rich, cell-specific nucleic acid barcodes. We attempt to use conservative imaging and labeling parameters, with the goal of establishing a baseline case that points to the potential feasibility of optical circuit reconstruction, leaving open the possibility of higher-performance labeling technologies and algorithms. We find that, even with these conservative assumptions, an all-optical approach to dense neural morphology reconstruction may be possible via the proposed algorithmic framework. Future work should explore both the design-space of chemical labels and barcodes, as well as algorithms, to ultimately enable routine, high-performance optical circuit reconstruction.",
