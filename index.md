# About 

I am a research engineer at the department of computing and intelligence at the Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR, Singapore. 
I work on AI for healthcare and FinTech.

Before that, I was a member in the [Learning, Intelligence and Signal Processing (LISP)](http://cs-people.bu.edu/spchin/) group in the Department of Computer Science at Boston University. My advisor was [Prof. Peter Chin](https://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/spchin/Welcome.html). I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and a master’s degree in Neuroscience from MIT, where I worked in the [Synthetic Neurobiology Group](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/) directed by [Prof. Ed Boyden](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/71/11). I have research experience in computer vision, bioinformatics, and neurobiology. My latest CV is available upon request.
