I am a Ph.D. student in the [Learning, Intelligence and Signal Processing (LISP)](http://cs-people.bu.edu/spchin/) group in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.bu.edu/cs/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu). My advisor is [Prof. Peter Chin](https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/sang-peter-chin/). I obtained my bachelor’s degree in electrical & electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and a master’s degree in brain and cognitive sciences from MIT where I worked in the Synthetic Neurobiology Group directed by Prof. Ed Boyden. I have research experience in computer vision, bioinformatics and neurobiology. My current research interests include machine learning, signal processing, and affective computing. I also enjoys teaching, reading, and making friends.
